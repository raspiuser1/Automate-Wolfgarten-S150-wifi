# Automate-Wolfgarten-S150-wifi
Automate your wolfgarten S300 lawn mower with an arduino ESP8266 wifi module and Control it via google Agenda

Upload the arduino sketch esp8266.ino to your ESP8266, I used a NODE MCU 1.0
Set your ip and dns first if need in the INO file, the arduino has 2 outputs.
1 output for the start knob and 1 for the stop button as there are only 2 buttons on the S315 wolfgarten
This arduino will go into your lawn mower,
